# moyer-calc
Functions to help calculate emission reductions for Carl Moyer Program projects.

Includes:
- Streamline two step emission reduction calculations.
- Bisection search to minimize total activity subject to maximizing potential grant amount.
- Calculate emission reductions for all combinations of multiple unit replacements, e.g., two for one, three for one, four for one, etc.
- Automated tests to ensure functions match documented examples.
